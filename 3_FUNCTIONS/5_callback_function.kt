// In Kotlin, a callback function refers to a function that is passed as an argument to another function, with the intention that it will be called or executed by that function at some point during its execution or in response to an event. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous programming, event handling, and various other scenarios where you want to execute certain code at a later time or in response to some external event.

// Here's a detailed explanation of callback functions in Kotlin:

// 1. **Function as a First-Class Citizen**: In Kotlin, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be treated as values. This allows functions to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just like any other data type.

// 2. **Passing Functions as Arguments**: Callback functions are typically passed as arguments to higher-order functions. A higher-order function is a function that either takes functions as parameters, returns a function, or both. By passing a function as an argument to another function, you can specify what action should be taken when the function is called or when some condition is met.

// 3. **Asynchronous Operations**: One common use case for callback functions is handling asynchronous operations such as network requests or file I/O. Instead of waiting for the operation to complete synchronously, you can pass a callback function to the asynchronous function, which will be invoked once the operation finishes or an event occurs.

// 4. **Event Handling**: Callback functions are often used in event-driven programming to handle user interactions or system events. For example, in Android development, you might define callback functions to respond to user clicks, gestures, or changes in the device's state.

// 5. **Anonymous Functions and Lambdas**: Callback functions can be defined using regular named functions, anonymous functions, or lambda expressions. Anonymous functions and lambdas are particularly convenient for defining short, inline callback functions without the need to explicitly declare a separate function.

// Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of a callback function in Kotlin:

 
// Higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument
fun performOperation(callback: () -> Unit) {
    // Perform some operation
    println("Performing operation...")
    
    // Invoke the callback function
    callback()
}

fun main() {
    // Define a callback function as a lambda expression
    val callback: () -> Unit = {
        println("Callback function called")
    }
    
    // Call the higher-order function and pass the callback function
    performOperation(callback)
}
 

// In this example, the `performOperation` function is a higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument. Inside `performOperation`, it performs some operation (printing a message) and then invokes the callback function passed to it. In `main()`, a callback function is defined as a lambda expression and passed to `performOperation`. When `performOperation` is called, it prints "Performing operation..." and then calls the callback function, which prints "Callback function called".
